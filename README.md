# Sentiment_Analysis_Covid19_Vaccinations_Tweets

**INTRODUCTION**

The global health crisis brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an unceasing stream of covid cases. On social media, millions of people expressed their views on vaccination in addition to the numerous organizations. In this regard, our study uses Twitter dataset to analyze the various perspectives of people about the Covid-19 vaccination. The word embedding method is being used in this effort to analyze the sentiment of the Covid-19 vaccination. The phrase "word embedding" refers to the representation of words for text analysis, often in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in order to predict comparable meanings for words that are adjacent to one another in the vector space. The sentiment analysis of the text that is included in the Twitter dataset is described in this notebook. Various NLP tools, including Nltk, Sklearn, Textblob, etc., as well as the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, will be used. The project is split into two sections. In the first section, we analyze the Twitter dataset by carrying out a number of operations such eliminating stop words, punctuation, stemming, and doing sentiment analysis on the text that contains. The following stage entails vectorization using TF-IDF. SVM, RandomForests, and KNN approaches are used to train the model. Finally, we will be assessing the model performance using unseen test data.
